## MACHINE LEARNING BASED REGRESSION PROJECT

## Content
### Overview:
Buying a home is dream come true for many this is regression based house price prediction problem in which having 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes from Number of beds, bathrooms, garage to types of material used every thing is consider in this Data. trained Machine Learning model with almost every Machine Leaning algorithm and tried to predicted the right price of House which helps to lots of customers to buy their dream house.

### Motivation
Those don't have real world experience in Data Science field, it's very good opportunity to start a work with this type of project, it having lots of Categorical feature, Missing values, Abnormal Data Distribution, giving very good understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis and dataset gives the feel of real world problem.

### Goal
1- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
2- Handle Missing Values
3- Handle Categorical features
4- Apply Transformation Technique's to make Normally Distributed
5- Feature Selection
6- Feature Scaling
7- Model Selection
8- Model Training
9- Hyperparameter Tuning
10- Prediction on Test Dataset
