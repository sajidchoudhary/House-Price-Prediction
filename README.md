## MACHINE LEARNING BASED REGRESSION PROJECT

## Content
### Overview
This is regression based house price prediction problem in which having 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes from Number of beds, bathrooms, garage to types of material used every thing is consider in this Data. I applied EDA Techniques, handled Missing values and categorical values than trained Machine Learning model with almost every Machine Leaning algorithm and tried to predicted the right price of House which helps to lots of customers to buy their dream house.

### Motivation
Those don't have real world experience in Data Science field, it's very good opportunity to start a work with this type of project, it having lots of Categorical feature, Missing values, Abnormal Data Distribution, giving very good understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis.

### Goal
Traing Data having 1460 rows and 79 variable from this try get which variables are imapcting the selling price basically apply EDA Techniques for get to know the hidden meaning of data and apply differenet different techniques to handle categorical features, some features are belongs to ordinal some are belongs to nominal , dataset having lots of Missing values and some belongs to Missing completely at Random, Missing not at Random, Missing at Random, make distribution as Normally Distributed by use Transformation Techniques than do Feature Selection in the last train a model using all Machine Leaning algorithm and choose one which will give best accuracy score.
